I have stumbled on this simplistic wiki engine that is suitable for personal notebooks, journals or as a simple knowledge base. The author have abandoned it, so I decided to fork it and do some minor tweaking.

## The Plan
Keep it simple and lightweight. Compatible with old hardware and software. Stay minimalistic. At the same time support modern PHP versions and browsers. Be at least readable on mobile.

## Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Features
- Advanced formatting options (using [Texy!](https://texy.info/en/syntax-full) syntax)
- Read-only mode
- Backlinks support
- Provides list of recent changes
- Custom 404 error – Head over to `Special:NotFound` and edit the page. Use `%PAGE%` as a placeholder for name of not found page.

## Installation
No special installation steps are required. Just copy the contents of `lib/` to your desired directory.
